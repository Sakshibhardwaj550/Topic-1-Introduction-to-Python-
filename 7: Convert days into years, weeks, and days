Write a python program to take number of days as input now display years, weeks
and days. E.g. If user input 375 days then output will be 1 years, 1 weeks and 3 days.
In this program ignore leap year.

# Program 7: Convert days into years, weeks, and days
days = int(input("Enter the number of days: "))

years = days // 365
weeks = (days % 365) // 7
remaining_days = (days % 365) % 7

print(f"{years} years, {weeks} weeks, and {remaining_days} days")
